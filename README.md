# Lit Sass Css Typescript Starter

This is a project that has a very simple setup for SASS + CSS + TS + Lit that uses rollup.

## Goals

* Get started with Lit + SASS + TS
* Learn how to setup rollup to support this config
* Not tested with LIT 1

## Get Started

Clone the repo. Then install.

```bash
npm install
```

Then start the dev server and rollup watchers

```bash
npm run dev
```

A browser window should open and rollup will watch your files for changes.
